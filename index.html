            <h2>Modal Quartertone Guitar Theory</h2>

                These diagrams give an idea of how quartertone modes work.
                This is loosely based on Maqam music theory (ie: Arabic/Turkish music).
                This system has a large variety of scales that are built of smaller chunks,
                and do not force alternation between major and minor tonalities.
                The use of quartertones gives a lot more scope for using minor tonalities in more places,
                along with some neutral ones.
                The theory I am laying out is however more oriented towards playing heavy metal on a quartertone guitar.

                <h3>Instruments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quartertone Electric - Reasonable approximations to Maqam can be played in a rock/metal context.
                        Pictured is a standard Stratocaster refretted for 24EDO (ie: 24 notes per octave, or doubled fretting).
                    <li>Fretless - Harder to fit in with standard instruments, but more true Maqam is playable .
                    <li>See <a href="http://www.maqamworld.com/">Maqam World</a> for a more standard treatment
                        of Maqam, including the microtonal details, and traditional features.  What I am documenting
                        is more oriented towards using 24EDO in a heavy metal context.
                    <li>The guys that actually built my quartertone guitar: <a href="http://www.metatonalmusic.com">Metatonal Music</a>
                </ul>
                <h3>Patterns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> keep in mind that fret numbers are <i>double</i> what they are on normal guitar.
                         conveniently, new strings start on multiples of 10, presuming it is tuned to all fourths as here.
                    <li> A small tone is the normal half tone in 12ET - <i>2 frets on quartertone guitar</i>
                    <li> A large tone is the normal whole tone in 12ET - <i>4 frets on quartertone guitar</i>
                    <li> A neutral tone is half-way in between small and large - <i>3 frets on a quartertone guitar</i>.
                    <li> It is almost always the case that neutral tones appear next to each other in pairs,
                         such that they span a minor third, and this minor third is on even frets to line up with 12EDO.
                    <li> In terms of frets: 0 4 6 is a "Minor" pattern, due to resembling bottom part of a minor scale. 
                    <li> In terms of frets: 0 2 6 is a "Phrygian" pattern, due to resembling bottom part of a phrygian scale. 
                    <li> In terms of frets: 0 3 6 is a "Bayati" pattern, due to having two neutral seconds right next to each other.
                </ul>

            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Over Minor Pentatonics</h3>
                When starting out on the root note (E in this case),
                if we have a <i>Minor Pentatonic</i> backing scale, then we make it <i>Bayati</i> by adding note 1.
                Being neither <i>Phrygian (ie: Kurd)</i> nor <i>Minor (ie: Nahawand)</i>, choosing Bayati picks note 0 as the clear root.
                From note 0 to note 2, a minor third is being cut exactly in half; something impossible on a 12EDO instrument.
                It has two medium second intervals next to each other, noted as "MM":

                <canvas id="diagram1"></canvas>
                <p> 
                Compare with Minor
                <p> 
                <canvas id="diagram1A"></canvas>
                <p> 
                Compare with Phrygian

                <p>
                As chord progressions change, the bottom half of the scales (tetrachords) define the
                notes in use.  Usually the scale isn't defined rigidly across the entire octave.
                The idea is to string together shorter partial scales.  In this way, many melodic
                runs will be full of accidentals, while still having a clear tonal character.

            <div class=subsections> 
                <h3>Modulating</h3>
                As we move up, we can either do Phrygian on B, or use Bayati on B.  
                In this position, Bayati is picked.
                Note that it exhibits some symmetry with Bayati on E from notes 3 through 5.
                Note 4 is a quartertone flat from being a fifth above B (an F&#9839;), so it is clearly connected to E.
                <p>
                <canvas id="diagram2"></canvas>
            </div>

            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Minor</h3>
                When modulating down to A, we pick the minor shaped scale.
                Because we are connecting to adjacent scales like Bayati on E and B, we probably want to preserve the B.
                It has large then small intervals, noted as "LS":
                <p>
                <canvas id="diagram3"></canvas>
            </div>
 
            <div class=subsections>
                Similarly, when modulating down to D, we pick the minor shaped scale.
                Because we want to preserve our minor third, we can make F natural.
                <p>

            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Phrygian</h3>
                We can visit Phrygian on E from D.
                It has small then large intervals, noted as "SL":
                <p>
                <canvas id="diagram5"></canvas>
            </div>

            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Hijaz</h3>
                New scale shape Hijaz (Phrygian sharp third).  Note that the wide interval is a major third wide.
                It is so wide, that sometimes this major third might be cut in half into a pair of intervals.
                It could be: LS, SL, or MM.  Using MM would be like Bayati on F!

                Note that if rooted on note 1, it's the harmonic minor tetrachord.

            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Rast</h3>
                Rast is a comon major-like scale (more like Dorian quartersharp minor third).  
                The root note is 0, but there is strong emphasis on 1 and 4.
                If 1 were the center, it would be Bayati.
                Notice the pattern of notes creeping up one fret per string.
                This is useful for visualizing fretboard location

            <h2>In Theory</h2>
            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Generic Shape</h3>
                <p>
                <canvas id="diagram10"></canvas>
                <p>
                More generally, the pentatonic core is stable; and other notes tend to move around
                to suit the circumstances.
                Note that in none of this have you seen an actual quartertone (1 fret) interval.
                The harmonics on a string generally dictate where notes will lie, and there isn't
                a useful second interval much smaller than a half tone (2 fret - small step).
                <p>
                <canvas id="diagram10a"></canvas>
                <p>
                This is another generic shape that arises, which is roughly centered around a Rast tonality.
                This scale is practically impossible to resolve with non-quartertone instruments playing along though. 
            </div>

            <div class=subsections>
                <h3>Harmonics</h3>
                The reasoning behind the importance of interval sizes has to do with harmonics.
                Harmonic 1 is the full string, 2 is octave, etc.
                The importance in the order: octave, fifth, fourth, maj third, min third are made obvious by harmonics up to  about 6.
                The more fine intervals get their importance from how well they evenly divide these intervals.
                This is why fret distances of 1 never appear in these scales.
                Small seconds intervals are somewhere from harmonic 18 to 15.
                Medium seconds intervals are somewhere from 13 to 11.
                Large seconds intervals are around 9 to 10.
                <p>
                <canvas id="diagram11"></canvas>
                <p>
                Notice that harmonic 5 is slightly flat of the nearby fret.
                This is why when playing a maj third interval between two strings, bend the bottom note
                up a little bit until the timbre of the chord cleans up (and the beating goes away).
                This narrows the distance between the two notes.
                <p>
                Similarly harmonic 6 is slightly sharp of the nearby fret.
                So when playing minor third intervals between two strings, bend the top note up
                a little bit until the timbre of the chord cleans up (again, eliminates beating).
                This stretches the distance between the two notes.
                <p>
                Other intervals like a semitone (ie: an E and F played together) can be made just by bending
                the F up a little bit to clean up the chord.  The locations of the harmonics make it clear
                what the pattern of adjustments for intervals is going to be.
